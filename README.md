# dockerize-node

As of initial commit, we have a 'hello-world.js' script.

If you have a local install of Node.js, you can run it by invoking `node hello-world.js`, and it will show you the text "Hello, world!"

Next step is to move that into Docker - which will let you run it even if you don't have Node.js installed locally.
